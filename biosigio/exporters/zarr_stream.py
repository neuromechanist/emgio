"""Streaming Zarr export for large recordings (bounded RAM).

The in-memory path (:meth:`ZarrExporter.export` via ``Recording.from_file`` +
``to_zarr``) holds the whole recording at float64: MNE ``preload=True``, then
``raw.get_data()``, then a pandas DataFrame, then a de-fragmenting ``.copy()`` --
peaking at 2-3x the recording size. An 18 GB iEEG recording (BrainVision) needs
~150 GB that way and OOMs the converter (worse under the Hallu cron's ``--jobs``
fan-out). The #95 fix only streamed the *exporter*; the *importer* still loads
everything.

This path keeps peak RAM bounded by ~one channel, independent of recording size:

1. Open the source LAZILY with MNE (``preload=False``) -- works for the formats
   NEMAR serves (``.fif`` / ``.vhdr`` / ``.set`` / ``.edf`` / ``.bdf`` / CTF
   ``.ds`` / MEF3 ``.mefd`` / 4D-BTi). MEF3 recordings in particular can be
   multi-GB iEEG sessions, so bounded-memory streaming is not optional for them.
2. Pass 1: stream the source in time-windows (``raw.get_data(start, stop)``) into
   a channel-major float32 memmap on scratch. RAM = one time-window; disk I/O is a
   single sequential pass (a per-channel read of a multiplexed source would instead
   scan the file once per channel).
3. Pass 2: for each channel, read its full row from the memmap, apply the BIDS
   unit conversion, resample + quantize it, and write it straight into the Zarr
   arrays (base row + its slice of each min/max pyramid level). RAM = one channel.

Between the two passes there is nothing to rescale in memory, so the BIDS
``_channels.tsv`` is applied to the *channel table* instead (``bids_channels``,
default ``"auto"``, mirroring ``Recording.from_file``): types and modalities move
immediately, and each declared unit becomes a per-channel factor pass 2 folds in
exactly once. Without that, a dataset whose recordings straddle a size threshold
served its small runs in the sidecar's unit and its large ones in the importer's
native unit -- self-consistent stores that disagree with each other by 10^6
(issue #127).

The resulting store is structurally identical to :meth:`ZarrExporter.export` and
numerically equal within int16 quantization: same layout, same attrs, same chunk
geometry -- ``level 0`` chunked and sharded on time (``chunk_seconds`` /
``shard_seconds``), every ``view/*`` level chunked on a constant column count
(``view_chunk_columns``, shared with the in-memory path through
:func:`~biosigio.exporters.zarr._view_chunk_columns` so the two cannot drift), and
each channel group declaring its pyramid via ``n_view_levels`` / ``view_levels``.
See :mod:`biosigio.exporters.zarr` for the layout block and the rationale. The
downsampling parameters and provenance are recorded in attrs, same as the
in-memory path. Requires both the ``zarr`` and ``meg`` (MNE) extras.

# --- Lazy stream sources (#944) -----------------------------------------------
# stream_to_zarr needs, per recording: sfreq, n_samples, and per-channel
# (label / biosigIO type / unit) metadata, plus windowed float64 blocks. MNE
# (preload=False) covers .fif/.vhdr/.set/CTF/.mefd/4D-BTi. EDF/BDF go through
# pyedflib INSTEAD -- biosigIO's in-memory path reads EDF via pyedflib, and MNE
# disagrees on EDF unit scaling (an EDF whose physical dimension is unknown: MNE
# assumes Volts, pyedflib keeps the file's dimension), so streaming EDF via MNE
# would NOT match a re-run on the in-memory path. pyedflib.readSignal(chn, start, n)
# is numerically identical to readSignal(chn) sliced, so the streamed store matches
# the in-memory store exactly. (EDF-via-stream is not used in production today, so
# switching its reader changes no existing store.) When pyedflib itself refuses to
# open the file (issue #109 and friends -- see ``..importers._edf_tolerant``),
# ``_EdfSource`` falls back to the SAME tolerant MNE-backed, unit-rescaled read the
# in-memory importer uses, so the two paths keep agreeing even on a recovered file.
#
# .mefd and 4D/BTi need their OWN reader call rather than MNE's generic
# ``read_raw()`` dispatch: .mefd additionally needs the MEF3 version/pymef gate
# (see ``..importers.mef3.require_mne_mef``), and a BTi directory has no
# extension for ``read_raw()`` to dispatch on at all (see
# ``..importers.meg._resolve_bti_reader_kwargs``, the same content-based
# detection AND config/hs_file sidecar resolution the in-memory importer uses --
# shared so the BTi precedence rule lives in exactly one place). Both still end
# up as a plain MNE ``Raw`` with ``preload=False``, so ``_MneSource`` accepts an
# already-opened ``raw`` (and an optional ``extra_metadata`` dict, e.g. which
# BTi processed-data file was actually read) and skips opening it again -- the
# windowed-read/channel-metadata code below is identical either way.
