        Low-resolution demos need a smaller, lighter recording; this rebuilds the
        uniform signal grid at ``target_rate`` using a polyphase resampler
        (``scipy.signal.resample_poly``), which applies a Kaiser-windowed sinc
        anti-alias FIR before decimation. A naive stride-decimation would fold
        energy above the new Nyquist back into the band (aliasing); resample_poly
        removes that energy first, so no aliasing occurs.

        Non-destructive: ``self`` is left untouched and a new Recording is returned,
        mirroring ``select_channels``'s copy semantics.

        Resampling factors come from the integer source/target rates:
        ``g = gcd(int(src), int(target)); up = int(target)//g; down = int(src)//g``
        and ``resample_poly(x, up, down)`` runs once, vectorized over all channels

                (this is a DOWN-sampling helper). A target equal to the source
                returns an unchanged copy; a target above it raises ``ValueError``
                rather than silently up-sampling (up-sampling cannot recover
                detail and is out of scope for the low-res pipeline).

        Returns:
            Recording: A new Recording with the resampled signals, each channel's
                ``sample_frequency`` set to the achieved rate (source * up / down,
                which equals ``target_rate`` for integer rates), and channel/recording
