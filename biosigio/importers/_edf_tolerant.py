"""Tolerant fallback for EDF/BDF files pyedflib's compliance checker rejects.

biosigIO's normal EDF/BDF path reads via ``pyedflib``, whose C-level ``open_file``
validator is stricter than the format's real-world variation. Three conditions,
all confirmed byte-intact and readable by MNE-Python, currently discard entire
recordings that are perfectly usable (issue #109 and the NEMAR Zarr backfill):

1. **Degenerate physical range** -- a channel with ``physical_min == physical_max``
   (a reference electrode in a referential montage, identically constant by
   construction). pyedflib: ``"... compliant (Physical Maximum)"`` /
   ``"(Physical Minimum)"``.
2. **Malformed numeric header field** -- a numeric header field padded with NUL
   bytes instead of the spec-mandated ASCII spaces (a real writer bug, not
   corruption; seen on ``number of data records``, but the same failure mode
   can hit any fixed-width numeric field). pyedflib:
   ``"... compliant (<field name>)"`` for a numeric field.
3. **Discontinuous EDF+D** -- the file is correctly marked discontinuous.
   pyedflib: ``"The file is discontinuous and cannot be read"``.

:func:`classify_pyedflib_error` recognizes exactly these three conditions from
pyedflib's exception message and returns ``None`` for anything else (including
the ``"Filesize"`` truncation check), so a genuinely corrupt/truncated file is
never misrouted here -- it keeps raising through the caller's
``classify_read_error`` as :class:`~biosigio.exceptions.CorruptFileError`.

:func:`read_edf_tolerant` does the actual recovery: it re-reads the file with
MNE (which tolerates all three conditions), then rescales MNE's SI-volt output
back to the SAME native physical units ``pyedflib`` would have produced --
MNE and pyedflib apply an *identical* digital-to-physical calibration
(``(physical_max - physical_min) / (digital_max - digital_min)``), MNE just
additionally multiplies by a unit-to-SI factor pyedflib does not apply. That
factor is read back off the just-opened ``Raw`` (:func:`_channel_gains`), which
is exactly what MNE actually multiplied in -- including any of MNE's own edge
cases in matching the dimension string -- rather than a best-effort duplicate
that could silently disagree. It is, however, cross-checked (still in
:func:`_channel_gains`) against an independent recomputation from the same
dimension string, so that a *future* MNE release changing what that private
attribute means -- not merely whether it exists -- is caught as a loud failure
rather than silently trusted. Dividing back out by the (verified) factor makes
a recovered read numerically identical to a normal pyedflib read for any
channel a normal read would have produced -- see
``test_edf_fallback.py::test_fallback_matches_pyedflib_reading``, which is the
load-bearing proof, not an assumption.

For a channel with a degenerate physical range, no calibration is defined (the
digital-to-physical slope is 0/0), so that channel's samples are set to the
constant ``physical_min`` (== ``physical_max``) throughout -- mathematically the
correct simplification of the scaling formula when the physical range collapses
to a point, and exactly zero for the common real-world case of a
grounded/referential channel with ``physical_min == physical_max == 0``.

A truncation safety net (:func:`_check_not_truncated`) still runs before any
fallback read: the on-disk file size is compared against the size the tolerantly
-parsed header implies, and a short file is treated as genuinely corrupt (the
original pyedflib error is re-raised) rather than silently handed to MNE, which
would otherwise just shrink the record count with a warning and return a
truncated recording.
