"""python-neo-backed importer for proprietary electrophysiology acquisition formats.

Reads continuous recordings from the many acquisition systems covered by
python-neo's unified reader layer (Intan .rhd/.rhs, Blackrock .ns1-.ns6,
Spike2/CED .smr/.smrx, Plexon .plx/.pl2, Micromed .trc, Neuralynx .ncs, ...)
into a :class:`~biosigio.core.emg.Recording`.

neo models a recording as Block -> Segment -> AnalogSignal, where each
AnalogSignal is one *signal stream*: a group of channels that share a sampling
rate (e.g. an Intan amplifier bank at 30 kHz versus an auxiliary ADC). biosigio's
single time grid holds one rate, so streams that share a rate are merged into
one Recording, while streams at different rates require an explicit ``stream``
selector. A multi-rate file is never silently collapsed to a single rate.

neo carries signal values, physical units, sampling rates, channel names, and
events, but not BIDS channel *types* (a .rhd file does not distinguish SEEG from
EEG). Channels therefore default to type ``OTHER``; pass ``channel_type=`` to
label an entire recording, or rely on a sibling BIDS ``_channels.tsv`` (applied
by :meth:`Recording.from_file`) for per-channel types.

neo is an optional, heavy dependency, imported lazily via :func:`require_neo`.
