"""Typed exceptions for biosigIO.

A small hierarchy so a caller (e.g. the NEMAR Zarr serving pipeline) can classify
*why* a recording could not be read/converted and surface a specific, stable
reason to users, instead of parsing English error strings out of MNE/pyedflib.

Every exception carries a machine-stable ``code`` (string). Catch :class:`BiosigIOError`
and branch on ``.code`` (or ``isinstance``); the codes are part of the public API
and are safe to map to user-facing copy downstream.

    from biosigio import BiosigIOError
    try:
        rec = Recording.from_file(path)
    except BiosigIOError as e:
        reason = REASONS.get(e.code, "could not be read")
        ...

The reverse-mapping of a low-level reader error to one of these types lives in
:func:`classify_read_error`, kept here (with the format knowledge) so importers
share one classifier rather than each re-inventing string matching.

    True when ``exc`` -- or something it masks -- reflects the host running out
    of memory, threads, or file descriptors, not a problem with the file being
    read.

    Resource exhaustion is never a property of the file: a ``MemoryError`` (or
    numpy's ``_ArrayMemoryError``, a ``MemoryError`` subclass) raised mid-read
    typically means the host was saturated (e.g. many parallel conversions),
    not that the recording is corrupt. Importers must let it -- and the
    thread/allocation/fd-exhaustion ``OSError``/``RuntimeError`` variants below
    -- propagate unchanged instead of reclassifying it as a permanent read
    failure, so a caller (e.g. NEMAR's converter) can retry instead of
    recording a deterministic failure. See :func:`classify_read_error`.

    Resource exhaustion can also be MASKED by cleanup: if a ``MemoryError`` is
    propagating and a ``finally``/context-manager ``__exit__``/``close()``
    during unwinding raises its OWN exception, that second exception -- not the
    ``MemoryError`` -- is what a caller's ``except`` actually binds, with the
    ``MemoryError`` attached as ``__context__`` (implicit chaining) or
    ``__cause__`` (an explicit ``raise ... from``). So this walks the chain --
    the exception itself, then ``__cause__`` or ``__context__``, up to
    :data:`_MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH` links -- rather than only checking the outermost
    exception.

    The resource-exhaustion re-raise is defence in depth: a caller that calls
