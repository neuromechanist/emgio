biosigIO is a Python package for biosignal import/export and manipulation across modalities (EEG, EMG, iEEG, MEG, and behavioral/marker streams). It provides a unified `Recording` interface for working with data from many acquisition systems and archives and exporting it to standardized and serving formats with harmonized metadata.

## Why biosigIO?

Working with biosignal data across multiple recording systems can be challenging due to:

- Different file formats
- Varied metadata structures
- Inconsistent channel naming
- Diverse sampling rates and filtering

biosigIO simplifies this process by providing a standardized interface for loading, manipulating, and exporting biosignal data regardless of the original source.

## Key Features

- **Multi-system support**:
  - EEGLAB set files (supported)
  - Delsys Trigno (supported)
  - OTB Systems (supported)
  - EDF/BDF(+) (supported, including annotations)
  - WFDB (supported, including annotations)
  - XDF/Lab Streaming Layer (supported, multi-stream)
  - MEG: `.fif` and CTF `.ds` via MNE (supported; `meg` extra)
  - BrainVision `.vhdr` via MNE (supported; `meg` extra)
  - MEF3 iEEG `.mefd` via MNE (supported; `mef3` extra -- mne>=1.12 plus pymef)
  - Proprietary electrophysiology via python-neo: Intan, Blackrock, Spike2, Plexon, Micromed, Neuralynx (supported; `neo` extra)
  - Generic CSV (supported with auto-detection)
  - Noraxon (planned)
  
- **Intelligent import**:
  - Automatic file format detection
  - Format-specific metadata extraction
  - Handling of specialized CSV formats
  - Automatic annotation/event loading (WFDB, EDF+/BDF+, and EEGLAB .set) into the events table, embedded back on EDF+/BDF+ export and carried in the Parquet/Arrow/Zarr serialization formats
  - LSL timestamp preservation for XDF files (for synchronization)
  
- **Intelligent export**:
  - Automatic determination of EDF/BDF format based on signal quality
  - Smart handling of precision requirements
  - BIDS-compatible metadata formatting
  - Annotation export (EDF+/BDF+)

- **Serialization & serving** (see [Serialization & Serving](formats/serialization.md)):
  - Parquet and Arrow/Feather: lossless columnar round-trip (analytics, fast IPC); `arrow` extra
  - Zarr: cloud-native serving store (viewing, inference, and training from one store), a derived downsampled copy; `zarr` extra
  
- **Data manipulation**:
  - Channel selection
  - Metadata handling
  - Event/Annotation handling (access, add)
  - Basic signal visualization
  - Raw data access and modification

## Quick Example

```python
from biosigio import Recording

# Load data with automatic format detection, will issue an error to indicate use of the `trigno` importer
rec = Recording.from_file('data.csv')  # Format detected from file extension

# Load data with explicit importer
rec = Recording.from_file('data.csv', importer='trigno')

# Plot specific channels
rec.plot_signals(['EMG1', 'EMG2'])

# Export to EDF/BDF (format automatically determined)
rec.to_edf('output.edf')  # Extension will be added if not provided
```
