"""Shared helper for tests that exercise a real, non-synthetic recording too
large to ship as a repo fixture (issue #123: the on008083 EDF regression test
needs an actual ~192 MiB file, not a hand-built stand-in, to prove the fix
against the exact allocation pattern that triggered the bug).

Real-data tests are opt-in and never run by accident: they need network
access, are slow, and are unrelated to biosigio's platform-independent unit
tests. Two independent gates, both a ``pytest.skip`` (never a hard failure):

* the ``BIOSIGIO_REAL_DATA`` environment variable must be set (any non-empty
  value) to opt in at all.
* the URL must actually be reachable -- a short-timeout request decides
  "offline" so a flaky network never fails the suite.

Usage::

    from biosigio.tests.real_data import fetch_real_recording

    def test_something():
        path = fetch_real_recording(
            "https://data.nemar.org/on008083/v1.0.0/sub-001/ses-01/eeg/"
            "sub-001_ses-01_task-HierPrior_eeg.edf",
            min_bytes=190_000_000,
        )
        ...

The downloaded file is cached under ``BIOSIGIO_REAL_DATA_CACHE`` (default
``~/.cache/biosigio/real_data``), OUTSIDE the repository -- never committed,
and shared across biosigio worktrees/branches on the same machine so a
192 MiB download only ever happens once per host, not once per worktree.

NOTE for other biosigio worktrees adding their own real-data test (e.g. the
view-chunks or units-rescale work): this module did not exist before issue
#123's fix and is intentionally minimal (one function, one cache policy).
Add your own ``fetch_real_recording(url, ...)`` call here rather than
hand-rolling a second download/cache/skip helper, so every real-data test in
the suite shares one cache directory and one opt-in policy.
