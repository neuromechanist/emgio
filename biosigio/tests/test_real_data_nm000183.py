"""Real-recording regression for the STREAMED sidecar path (issue #127).

``test_real_data_nm000182.py`` pins the in-memory half of the unit fix on a real
recording; this pins the streaming half, on the dataset the disagreement was
actually reported on. NEMAR ``nm000183`` (Nejedly et al. 2020 SEEG
graphoelements, public) is 632 BrainVision runs, and exactly one of them --
``sub-012`` ``run-012``, 311 MiB -- sits above NEMAR's 256 MiB streaming
threshold. So the dataset genuinely straddled it: 631 runs converted in memory
and served the sidecar's ``uV``, this one converted by streaming and served
MNE's SI ``V``, six orders of magnitude apart inside one dataset, with the
per-channel ``type`` differing too (``SEEG`` against MNE's ``EEG`` guess).

The assertions are therefore about the run that streams: its store must carry
``uV`` on microvolt-scaled values, and must match an in-memory export of the
*same file* channel for channel.

Opt in and run it
-----------------

The recording is ~311 MB and is **not** committed. Set ``BIOSIGIO_REAL_DATA=1``
to opt in; without it the tests skip, so the default suite stays offline and
fast::

    BIOSIGIO_REAL_DATA=1 uv run pytest biosigio/tests/test_real_data_nm000183.py

Download, caching and the offline skip are :mod:`biosigio.tests.real_data`'s job
(cache: ``~/.cache/biosigio/real_data``, overridable with
``BIOSIGIO_REAL_DATA_CACHE``). A BrainVision recording is four files -- the
``.vhdr`` names its ``.eeg`` and ``.vmrk`` siblings by bare filename, and
``find_channels_tsv`` looks for the ``_channels.tsv`` next to the header -- so
all four are fetched under their own names into that one flat cache directory,
which is the adjacency MNE and BIDS both expect.

The in-memory comparison loads a 4.5-hour single-channel recording at float64
and peaks around 4.5 GB of RAM; that is the point of the comparison (it is the
path the streaming one has to agree with), not an oversight. The streaming
conversion of the same file stays bounded, which is why the threshold exists.

data.nemar.org returns an intermittent HTTP 500 on a small fraction of requests,
independent of file or client, so an occasional skip on a working network is
expected; re-run and the cached files make it moot.
