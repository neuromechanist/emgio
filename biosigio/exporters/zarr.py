"""Zarr exporter for biosignal recordings (biosigIO serving format).

Writes a single, cloud-native store that serves three jobs from one conversion:
fast edge viewing, edge/batch inference, and training-time streaming. The design
follows a few correctness rules:

- ``level 0`` of every channel group is the **canonical inference signal**,
  anti-aliased and resampled to a per-modality rate (250 Hz for EEG/MEG, 1000 Hz
  for iEEG/EMG by default), never upsampled.
- A **min/max view pyramid** sits above level 0 (``<group>/view/<L>``). These
  levels are nonlinear envelopes for rendering only and are flagged
  ``usable_for_inference=False`` so nobody trains on them by mistake.
- Heterogeneous channels (mixed types/units, and the rarer mixed native rates
  that BIDS allows within a modality) are grouped by ``(modality, native rate)``
  so every array stays internally length-consistent. Trigger/clock channels are
  resampled without anti-aliasing (nearest sample) to preserve step edges.
- Signals are stored ``int16`` with a per-channel ``scale``/``offset`` by default
  (half the bytes of float32; ML casts on read). Pass ``dtype="float32"`` for a
  lossless store.

The original full-rate recording is never the source of truth here; that stays in
the BIDS archive. This store is a derived serving copy, and the downsampling
parameters are recorded in attrs so it is reproducible. zarr is an optional
dependency (the ``zarr`` extra), imported lazily.

Layout (one root group per recording)::

    /                         root attrs: provenance, modality_rates, metadata
      <modality>_<rate>hz/    one group per (modality, native rate); attrs declare
                              the pyramid and the chunk geometry
        0                     (n_ch, n_time) base signal, anti-aliased. Chunked and
                              sharded on TIME (``chunk_seconds`` / ``shard_seconds``),
                              the granularity inference and training reads want.
        view/1, view/2, ...   (2, n_ch, n_time_L) min/max envelopes. Chunked on a
                              constant COLUMN count (``view_chunk_columns``), NOT on
                              time: a viewport needs ~1-2k columns at whatever level
                              it picks, so a time-based chunk would shrink fourfold
                              per level and turn one screen into hundreds of tiny
                              requests (a whole-recording view of a 40-minute store
                              was 594 requests for 1.16 MB; at 1024 columns it is 3).
      events/                 onset, duration, code arrays + label_map attr

Every channel group declares its pyramid and geometry in attrs -- ``n_view_levels``,
``view_levels``, ``view_downsample``, ``view_chunk_columns``, ``chunk_seconds``,
``shard_seconds`` -- so a reader plans its reads instead of probing ``view/1``,
``view/2``, ... until a 404. ``format_version`` stays at 2 for these: they are
additive attrs plus a chunk-shape change, and every Zarr v3 reader takes chunk
shapes from the array metadata it must already parse.
