"""Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) sidecar helpers.

When a data file follows the BIDS layout, the authoritative per-channel
metadata lives in a sibling ``*_channels.tsv`` (the ``type`` and ``units``
columns), not in the data file's own headers. These helpers locate that sidecar
and apply it to an :class:`~biosigio.core.emg.Recording` object so imported channels get
their real BIDS types (e.g. ``SEEG``) instead of header/label guesses.

The ``units`` column is a claim about the numbers, not just a label, so adopting
it rescales the samples (see :func:`_decide_unit`). Applying a sidecar therefore
leaves values and unit in agreement, which relabelling alone did not.

**Two callers, one decision table.** :func:`apply_channels_tsv` serves the
in-memory path (a whole :class:`~biosigio.core.emg.Recording` in RAM, whose
columns are rescaled in place), and :func:`apply_channels_tsv_to_stream` serves
the bounded-memory streaming exporter (no Recording exists; the samples arrive
window by window later). Both route every per-channel question through
:func:`_decide_unit`, which decides and returns rather than mutating, so the two
export paths cannot drift on what a sidecar means -- the failure issue #127
reports, where a dataset's small runs served microvolts and its large ones served
volts.

    **The single decision table for both export paths.** It answers the question

    edit that implies -- rescaling a DataFrame column now
    (:func:`apply_channels_tsv`) or carrying a factor into a later windowed read
    (:func:`apply_channels_tsv_to_stream`). Splitting the answer from the edit is
    the whole point: a store built by streaming and a store built in memory must
    disagree about nothing (issue #127).

    A unit label is a claim about the numbers next to it, so the two move
    together or not at all. The sidecar's ``units`` describes the values *as the
    data file stores them*, while the importer's unit describes the values
    biosigIO currently holds -- and those differ whenever the importer rescaled
    on the way in (every MNE-backed importer returns SI volts regardless of the
    file's own µV). Adopting the label without the conversion is what issue #122
    reports: volts relabelled as microvolts, wrong by 10^6.

    The checks run in this order, and the order is load-bearing:

    1. **Already there** (labels equal): nothing at all. This is what makes
       repeated application idempotent, and it comes first so a discrete or
       sample-less channel whose unit already matches is not flagged as a
       conflict with itself.
    2. **Discrete channel type** (``TRIG`` and friends, see
       :data:`~biosigio.core.channel_types.DISCRETE_CHANNEL_TYPES`): never
       rescaled. MNE labels stim channels with the FIFF volts code while they
       hold integer event codes, so a sidecar declaring ``mV`` would turn codes
       5/3/7 into 5000/3000/7000. The declared unit is recorded, not applied.
    3. **No samples**: a channel with metadata but no column cannot be rescaled,
       so it is not relabelled either -- checked before the conversion so even a
       same-magnitude spelling change cannot slip through on a channel whose
       numbers are not there to agree with it. (Always false for a streamed
       channel: every channel the source lists has a row in the transpose memmap.)
    4. **Convertible** (same quantity, e.g. ``V`` -> ``uV``): multiply the samples
       by the ratio and set the label. A ratio of exactly 1 (``uV`` -> ``µV``, a
       spelling difference) sets the label alone, which is not a semantic relabel.
    5. **Not convertible** (unparsable on either side, or different quantities):
       keep the importer's values *and* its label, and record the sidecar's claim
       under ``bids_unit`` so the BIDS metadata is preserved without being
       asserted over numbers that would contradict it.

    Whenever the sidecar's unit *is* adopted, any ``bids_unit`` left by an
    earlier disagreement is dropped, so the two never both describe the channel.

    A BIDS ``_events.tsv`` is the curated event table for a recording; it is
    richer and more reliable than the data file's own markers (e.g. a
    BrainVision ``.vmrk`` or an EEGLAB event struct), so when it is present it
    is the source of truth. This loads it into ``rec.events`` as the standard
    ``onset``/``duration``/``description`` frame, overwriting any
    importer-loaded events.

    Columns:
        ``onset`` (required, seconds) and ``duration`` (seconds; ``n/a`` or
        missing -> ``0.0``) follow the BIDS spec. The ``description`` is taken

        ``trial_type`` then ``value`` that is present and not ``n/a`` (BIDS
        names the categorical label ``trial_type`` and the raw marker
        ``value``; datasets populate one or both). Rows whose ``onset`` is
        missing or non-numeric are skipped.

    Args:
        rec: The Recording object to update in place.
        events_tsv_path: Path to the BIDS ``_events.tsv``.
